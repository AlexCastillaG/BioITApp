# BioIT APP

https://bioitresearching.wordpress.com/

Our main goal is to predict the production of the different crops on the peninsula of Spain and the Balearic Islands by training a machine learning model, to estimate production values based on environmental conditions to optimize the use of the territory. With a vision of the future, we are managing to determine the most favorable areas for the different crops as a guideline.

We highly recommend to run the app on Linux, it is also necessary to install those libraries:

````
pip install PySimpleGUI
pip install sklearn
pip install xgboost
pip install folium
pip install geopandas
pip install numpy
````

The code is divided in 3 parts, machine learning, map representation and GUI module
