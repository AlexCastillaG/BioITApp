#BioIT APP
Our main goal is to predict the production of the different crops on the peninsula of Spain and the Balearic Islands by training a machine learning model, to estimate production values ​​based on environmental conditions to optimize the use of the territory. With a vision of the future, we are managing to determine the most favorable areas for the different crops as a guideline.

The code is divided in 3 parts, machine learning, map representation and GUI module

There is also 2 types of databases, enviromentals and production which are used to procces the data
